I have created an app for the concerned person(Sunita) with the following features.

SOS feature - 
        This button will provide immediate access to the contact numbers of Ambulance and Family Doctors. (I have added sample numbers which can be edited with real
        numbers).
 
 Prescriptions - 
         This button will provide access to all the doctor given prescriptions date wise so that it is easily accessible while purchasing the medicines.
         Also while visiting a doctor she can immediately show her routine medicines.(I have added sample prescriptions which can be replaced with real ones).
         
Reports -
         This button will provide access to all the medical reports of the person whenever it is needed. As new Reports and new Prescriptions are generated day by day,
         these will be added by the app developer so that we can always keep the app in read-only mode forever so that the data cannot be tampered with.
   
What is next -
          This button in the app wll give all the medicines to be taken on a particular day along with healthy breakfast, lunch and dinner suggestions as per the major 
          health condition.(I have added a sample routine which can be replaced with real routine and medicines).
